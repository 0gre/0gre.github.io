I recently finished my Master in environmental engineering at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) in Vienna. The topic of my Master thesis was the development of a software as part of a semi-automatic monitoring system for fish migration in fish passes. The thesis can be found [here](http://permalink.obvsg.at/bok/AC13359496) (in German only).
For the moment I continue to work as a research assistant at the Institute of Water Management, Hydrology and Hydraulic Engineering at the BOKU university.
